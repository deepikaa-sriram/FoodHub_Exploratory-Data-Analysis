# FoodHub Data Analysis
This was a project I completed as part of the Applied Data Science Program at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology. 
Using raw data from a hypothetical company "FoodHub", I conducted a univariate and multivariate analyses in order to synthesize meaningful insights and provide appropriate business recommendations.
